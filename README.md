## App Design Project

### App Name: PacePal AI

----

## Overview:
This project simulated the development of an LLM-based application, using the LangChain framework and calls to the gpt-3.5-turbo model using the openai library within Python. Among the steps simulated within the app development process included: researching and compiling training data, mapping user scenarios and pathways, and training the model on specified information/data.

### Description
Our aim is to develop an application that utilizes LLM output trained specifically on data related to higher level sports and athletic development. The intention is for the application to be used by an athlete of any caliber (amateur to professional/elite), and will provide the user with a more targeted, unique level of detail in its output related to elevating athletic performance to the desire of the user. In other words, the application is designed to take the role of, say, an elite level coach whose expertise and advice is now offered in a more widely accessible format. Because this is being designed by two D1 athletes of different sports-XC/Track & Field and basketball-we have both access to explicit training regiments and a greater sense of what kind of training optimizes different athletic goals. Therefore, this kind of information (pace charts, basic knowledge from practice, etc.) is either directly accessible and can be fed into the application training data, or it is information we have a direction for researching further and can continue finding more specific detail on, so as to maximize the accuracy and scope of output. This application is intended to be a step above the average health fitness tracker, because it offers tailored, extensive and expert advice that adapts to the level of the user, in terms of knowledge and athletic ability. Further, the application allows for more engagement with user queries, instead of a device or application that simply tracks certain biometric measures. The idea behind our application is that it is a chatbot to be integrated within existing fitness tracker applications (i.e. Garmin Connect, iPhone's built in Health App, Strava, etc.), so that our application has direct access to an individual's training data, and can answer specific questions of the user. In sum, the application will be a chatbot that specializes in giving running advice.
