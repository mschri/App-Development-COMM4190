    "## App overview/idea:\n",
    "Originally the app was intended to be in use for athletes of all levels and different sports. For a more narrow and specific purview, we chose to center the app on running-specific tasks and info generation (mostly for the sake of training data simplicity). So the following user scenarios will be tailored towards running-specific queries and information gathering. The application is still intended to be used by athletes or individuals working within/interested in the running domain (i.e. coaches of all levels, assistant coaches, etc.)."
