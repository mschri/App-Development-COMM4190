    "## Description\n",
    "Our aim is to develop an application that utilizes LLM output trained specifically on data related to higher level sports and athletic development. The intention is for the application to be used by an athlete of any caliber (amateur to professional/elite), and will provide the user with a more targeted, unique level of detail in its output related to elevating athletic performance to the desire of the user. In other words, the application is designed to take the role of, say, an elite level coach and allowing their knowledge to be more widely accessible. Because this is being designed by two D1 athletes of different sports-XC/Track & Field and basketball-we have both access to explicit training regiments and a greater sense of what kind of training optimizes different athletic goals. Therefore, this kind of information is either directly available to us and can be fed into the application training data (i.e. training data during a specific session, specific pace charts for running), or it is information we have a direction for researching further and can continue finding more specific detail on so as to offer the best possible advice the user seeks. This is also perhaps why this particular application may be a step above the average health fitness tracker, because it offers tailored, extensive advice depending on the athletic ability of the user and uses different health and fitness measures as inputs. The idea behind our application is for it be integrated within existing fitness tracker applications (i.e. Garmin Connect, iPhone's built in Health App, Strava, etc.), so that our application has direct access to an individual's training data, and can answer specific questions of the user.\n"
