      "\n",
      "Block 4 Objective – The primary goal of this workout is to introduce two new types of workouts – 1) progression runs (which will then become more intensive tempo effots) and 2) interval efforts at race effort or race pace. \n",
      "\n",
      "The progression runs are a continuation of the marathon paced work that we have been doing. This will continue to help you gain aerobic strength and cardiovascular fitness. The priotity in progression runs is the ability to get faster every mile. This means that these efforts will be harder and more taxing than a marathon paced run. Make sure you know your targets when you are starting these workouts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The interval efforts are the introduction of race pace work. As we get into August, we are less than 1 month away from our first competition of the season. This means we are going to start entering our pre-competition phase of training. The reminder is that we do NOT want to be at our peak fitness in August. These workouts should be building both in volume and pace throughout the season. Just because we are starting with short bouts of interval efforts, doesn’t mean we should overrun them and make them into a different type of workout. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we should all be at our near your peak volume. This is a big block of training in both volume and intensity. Ensure that you are continuing to take care of your body and make the appropriate pacing decisions with your long runs and with your recovery based days. Remember, we are only getting better if your body is able to recover from the work that you are doing!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary goal – Build high levels of aerobic strength and cardiovascular fitness through progression runs and marathon paced efforts\n",
      "Second goal – Introduce interval efforts which will prepare your body for race paced workouts and races in the near future\n",

      "\n",
      "The reminder is to continue building on the distance that you are able to control these paces. If you have been going 4 miles consistently, try to go 5 for this one. You have the freedom to go as far as 7 miles if you are able to handle that type of volume. But remember, control the paces and try to get more volume!!\n",

We want to get 20-30 minutes of total threshold running here. So if you get through 2 of these, but don’t think you could get through a 3rd, try to do 4-6 minutes of a 3rd rep.
