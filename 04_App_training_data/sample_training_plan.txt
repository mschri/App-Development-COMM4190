Penn Women’s XC Summer Training
Block 3 (July 29th – August 23rd)

Block 4 Objective – The primary goal of this workout is to introduce two new types of workouts – 1) progression runs (which will then become more intensive tempo effots) and 2) interval efforts at race effort or race pace. 

The progression runs are a continuation of the marathon paced work that we have been doing. This will continue to help you gain aerobic strength and cardiovascular fitness. The priotity in progression runs is the ability to get faster every mile. This means that these efforts will be harder and more taxing than a marathon paced run. Make sure you know your targets when you are starting these workouts. 

The interval efforts are the introduction of race pace work. As we get into August, we are less than 1 month away from our first competition of the season. This means we are going to start entering our pre-competition phase of training. The reminder is that we do NOT want to be at our peak fitness in August. These workouts should be building both in volume and pace throughout the season. Just because we are starting with short bouts of interval efforts, doesn’t mean we should overrun them and make them into a different type of workout. 

Finally, we should all be at our near your peak volume. This is a big block of training in both volume and intensity. Ensure that you are continuing to take care of your body and make the appropriate pacing decisions with your long runs and with your recovery based days. Remember, we are only getting better if your body is able to recover from the work that you are doing!!

Primary goal – Build high levels of aerobic strength and cardiovascular fitness through progression runs and marathon paced efforts
Second goal – Introduce interval efforts which will prepare your body for race paced workouts and races in the near future
Tertiary goal – Sustain volume or continue building towards your peak volume



Week 1 

Monday -	Recovery Distance Run + post run drills and 6x10 sec hills

Tuesday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	4-7 mile tempo run @ marathon pace
 
This is our final true marathon paced tempo effort of the summer. From here on, we will either be doing progression runs, or lactate threshold tempos. We will continue to see marathon paced fartleks in spicy long runs, or as short tempo efforts to begin workouts.

The reminder is to continue building on the distance that you are able to control these paces. If you have been going 4 miles consistently, try to go 5 for this one. You have the freedom to go as far as 7 miles if you are able to handle that type of volume. But remember, control the paces and try to get more volume!!

		
Wednesday -	Recovery Distance Run + 6 x 100 meters strides

Thursday- 	Recovery Distance Run / XT / OFF

Friday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	2-3 x 10:00 on / 2:30 off @ lactate threshold pace
	Finish with 4 x 30 sec hills with walk back recovery

	 This is a continuation of the last 4 weeks of lactate threshold efforts. Try to keep the pace of these efforts as close to the others as possible. We want to get 20-30 minutes of total threshold running here. So if you get through 2 of these, but don’t think you could get through a 3rd, try to do 4-6 minutes of a 3rd rep. It is important to continue growing the volume, and working on the paces of threshold runs that we can control.

Saturday - 	Recovery Distance Run 
		
Sunday - 	Steady Quality Long Run 




Week 2 

Monday -	Recovery Distance Run + post run drills and 5x10 sec hills

Tuesday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	4-5 mile progression run from marathon pace to threshold pace

	This is the first continuous tempo run where we are targeting a steady progression of paces. This will be harder than your marathon paced runs, but also a bit shorter for this one. A strong priority should be on the ability to progress through each mile of this tempo. Thing of trying to get 5-10 seconds faster each mile. 

	For example, if you have done 5 miles @ 6:20 pace for a marathon paced run, a good place to target would be 5 miles @ 6:25-6:20-6:15-6:10-6:05. If you need help with specific pacing goals, please be sure to reach out!!

		
Wednesday -	Recovery Distance Run + 6 x 100 meter strides

Thursday- 	Recovery Distance Run / XT / OFF

Friday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	10 x 1:30 on/1:30 off @ 5k effort
	Finish with 4x30 second hills

	This is meant to be our first race pace effort of the season, so we are starting with short efforts. This should not be a killer workout. You should be able to finish this workout feeling like you to could do 4-5 more of these efforts. Think of this as an introduction to interval workouts that you could build upon with your current level of fitness. 
 

Saturday - 	Recovery Distance Run
		
Sunday - 	 Recovery Paced Long Run 
	
	Make sure to keep this really recovery paced. You will have a very tough block of training over the next 2 weeks. This does not have to be your hardest long run. 



Week 3 

Monday -	Recovery Distance Run + post run drills and 5x10 sec hills

Tuesday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	4-5 mile progression run @ lactate threshold pace

	This is meant to be the continuation of your workout from last week. Similar to what we’ve done all summer, we want to prioritize seeing some progression in either pace of volume. If you were able to do 5 miles last week, try progressing to a slightly faster pace by the end. If you did 4 last week, try to get to 4.5 or 5 miles this week. But continue prioritizing the ability to progress in each mile of the workout. This will require you to start controlled. 
 
				
Wednesday -	Recovery Distance Run + 6 x 100 meter strides


Thursday- 	Recovery Distance Run / XT / OFF

Friday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	12-14 x 400 @ 5k pace with 1:30 rest
	6 x 200 @ 1500 pace with 1:30 rest

	This can be done on any surface you desire. This is the same type of workout we did last week, but this time we are adding a specific pacing goal. If you don’t do this on the track, you should plan to measure out 400 meters so that you can work on running a specific pace/rhythm. 

	Make sure to use your current level of fitness when deciding what pace to run. If you have been running 6:00 pace for threshold work, a good goal would be to run these at 82-84 second pace! It is okay if that feels controlled. 5k pace for 400 meters should not be an incredibly challenging effort!


Saturday - 	Recovery Distance Run
		
Sunday - 	Spicy Long Run – normal full distance, but add 4x5:00 @ marathon pace with 3:00 between bouts. 

Start your first pickup after 3-4 miles of steady easy running. If you feel okay after these, you can feel free to finish at a quality pace. If you are feeling beat up from the week of training, or fatigued from these efforts, you can finish the rest of the run at a recovery pace. 




Week 4

Monday -	Recovery Distance Run + post run drills and 5x10 sec hills

Tuesday - 	10-15 min w/u + c/d
	5 x 1600 @ threshold pace with 60 sec rest
 		Finish with 4x30 sec hills.

I would prefer for this to be done on the roads if you can. This is meant to simulate a broken tempo. Target the lactate threshold paces that you were able to run during your fartleks throughout the summer.
